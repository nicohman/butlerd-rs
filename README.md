# butlerd-rs
butlerd-rs is a rust interface for itch.io's [butlerd](https://github.com/itchio/butler). Currently in development. No responses to SSE's are implemented yet, though almost everything else from the [API](http://docs.itch.ovh/butlerd/master/#/) is. Working on SSE's, but not currently sure as to how they should be implemented. Very open to feedback and bug reports. Docs are [here](https://docs.rs/butlerd). Note: The tests will almost certainly fail on any system other than mine due to different CaveIDs. Will be fixed.
